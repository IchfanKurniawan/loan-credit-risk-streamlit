## Loan Credit Risk Prediction - Web Apps

As a part of the final project in Rakamin & ID/X Partner Virtual Internship, I with a role of Data Scientist had to build a model to predit loan credit risk of a bank/lender.

To further showcase this project, I build this web application of the project so everyone could try the model built.

you could check the web application [here](https://loan-credit-risk-streamlit.herokuapp.com/)

Programming language used: Python

Full steps on how to build model you could check [here](https://github.com/IchfanKurniawan/loan-credit-risk-DS002)

Libraries used in this project were:
1. Numpy
